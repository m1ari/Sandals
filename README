Pi Based Tracker written in multithreaded C++

This is an attempt at bit banging a GPIO Pin to generate RTTY rather than sharing the UART with GPS and Radio Module

No warranty of the fitness of this code for any purpose is given, As it's directly accessing the memory used for the GPIO interface it could cause kernel panics (or worse), backup and backup often. You have been warned!



Features To Add
 * Set System Date and Time if not already set
 * GPS
   * Track number of seen sats (and which ones)
   * UBlox specific features in GPS Class
 * Images
   * Grab Images from Pi CAM
   * SSDV
   * Add Location EXIF Data to images
 * APRS
   * PWM on GPIO, or Soundard
 * DominoEX


Possible future changes
  * Move RTTY / DominoEX into kernel space
  * Use timer interupt for timing (rather than usleep)

Typing changes
  use the C++ String Class rather than char*
  use unint16_t from <csdtint> instead of "unsigned short int" for checksum
