Pi Based Tracker written in multithreaded C++

This is an attempt at bit banging a GPIO Pin to generate RTTY rather than sharing the UART with GPS and Radio Module

Features To Add
 * Set System Date and Time if not already set
 * UBlox specific features in GPS Class
 * Images
   * Grab Images from Pi CAM
   * SSDV
   * Add Location EXIF Data to images
 * APRS
   * PWM on GPIO, or Soundard
 * RTTY
   * Only change baud rate/bits when a new string is selected
 * DominoEX

 * Telem String
   * Add Altitude
   * Add Satellite count & Lock indicator
   * Maidenhead locator


Possible future changes
  * Move RTTY / DominoEX into kernel space
  * Use timer interupt for timing (rather than usleep)



Typing changes
  use the C++ String Class rather than char*
  use unint16_t from <csdtint> instead of "unsigned short int" for checksum
